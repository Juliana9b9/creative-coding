    <title>Final Project</title> 
    <!--
        My original intention with this project was to recreate our solar system as accurately as possible. The first step was to correct the planets' sizing, which was easy. The problems began with getting the planets' texture and colors correct. I thought it would look good by only filling in the planet's colors, but it didn’t. Since they are 3d objects, you must texturize them or implement an image. I tried to implement an image, but most of the images I tried were blocked. I needed to think of a new approach. Saturn and the ring around it were the only planets I could create with slight accuracy. The ring ended up being vertical but could rotate around Saturn. I then thought just to make up planets and put them in random places. P5js has different 3d shapes, so I thought about how to utilize them in my project. I decided to somehow use each shape in each of my planets. Technically, the green moon rotates around several planets. The polka dot planets utilize the sphere shape, and I changed the sizing and position of the spheres so it look like little mountains. The orange fruit planet used the cylinder object. It’s for the green art of an orange where the stem was connected before being plucked from the tree. The in-half blue planet used the plane object. The iridescent blue looked cool with a blue planet and blended nicely.
The ice cream planet uses the cone object as its waffle cone. The disc planet uses the ellipsoid object to give “wings.” Finally, the dango planet also uses the cylinder object. I figured I could emulate some food on a stick, so why not dango? Lighting was a crucial part of this project. We only see planets because of the sun. I made the light softer so you could still see the vibrant colors of the planets. None of my prior works inspired this project, but I had minimal experience using Blender. The donut tutorial is infamous as the first creation you have to make in Blender. I was then inspired by those 3d space games on the app store where you can explore the planets from different angles. Some connections between my work and any important themes in the broader community of creative coding are the innovative ways to recreate something in our real world. I have seen projects that have recreated a train window, so you can see things pass by the window. Several other projects have recreated realistic-looking water. Sometimes, our greatest inspirations in the creative coding community are things that already exist, like nature. Another important theme that my project and creative coding have in common is the intersection of art, technology, and mathematics. My project has minimal use of math, but it combines art and technology. Digital art has become popular with creative coding and all it can accomplish with artistic attributes. Some may say it isn’t art because you’re using a computer, but that is false. You’re using your creativity, coding knowledge, and mathematics to make the art look how you want.
