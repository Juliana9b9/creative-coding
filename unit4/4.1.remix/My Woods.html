This is my remix version of Through the Park by Nick Montfort original link: https://nickm.com/poems/through_the_park.html
Copyright (c) 2024, 2019 Nick Montfort <nickm@nickm.com>

  It follows a story that is mixed with elements from Alice in Wonderland 
  and Little Red Riding Hood. I thought it'd be interesting to use random sentences 
  from each story to see how this would end, either in wonderland or in the forest.
