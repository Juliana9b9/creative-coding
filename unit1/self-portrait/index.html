    <title>Juliana's Self Portrait</title> 
    <!--
        I decided for my project I would present data on how often I stay awake until 1:00 am in a week. I started to count how many hours it would take me to fall asleep knowing I had to get up at a certain time. I also decided to take insipation from Shan Huang's Iconic History extension. I thought of using emojis as the hours instead of using only numbers for data. For the image I used a creative use picture of a moon, the URL is directly from the website.

    <h2 style="font-size:30px; color: gold; font-family:courier new;">How Many Hours Does It Take For Me To Fall Asleep from 10:00 pm Monday-Friday</h2>
    <h3 style=" font-size:28px; color: black; font-family: courier new;">Hi! My name is Juliana and I'm 100% a night owl. I thought it'd be interesting just how much time it takes me to fall asleep and what's considered a 'night owl'. </h3>

<!--
    i decided to add a key for this since certain moon emojis can be minutes and hours. The full moon represents one full hour, waning gibbous moon equals 15 minutes, last quarter moon equals 30 minutes, waining cresent equals 45 mintues.

    <p style="font-size:15px;font-family: courier new;">&#127765; = one full hour, &#127766; = equals 15 minutes, &#127767; = equals 30 minutes, &#127768; = equals 45 mintues.</p>
