    <!--
        The quote I decided to use is from Charles Eames: Advice for Students. I just thought it fit with how I'm creating my work from code, which would possibly be considered art.

    <!--
        Here I wanted to change the positioning of the words to the right or close enough to the center. Chose to enlargen 'the art' and its spacing. Kept the other words small.  
    --> 

<style type="text/css">]
      
       div {
            width:100%;
            overflow:auto;
            }
            
            div {
            width:50%;
            float:right;
            }
            
             
       
        h1 {
            font-size: 150px;
            margin-top: 1;
            margin-bottom:1;
            line-height: 70%;
            letter-spacing:25px;
        }
        
        
        p {
            font-size: 50px;
            margin-top: 1;
            margin-bottom:1;
            line-height: 75%;
            letter-spacing:0px;
        }

<!-- 
    This section was mostly just to change the colors of the words, I decided to use gold and white for the art, kinda to represent a blank canvas in a gold frame. The two paragraphs following would be like text about the canvas in times new roman. The last one would be like theh artist signature.

<div>
    <h1
    style='color: white; font-family: inherit; background-color: gold;'>The Art</h1>

    <p
    style='color: red; font-family: times new roman;'>Is Not Something</p> 
    <p
    style='color: tomato; font-family: times new roman;'>You Apply To</p> 
    <p
    style='color: black; font-family: cursive;'>Your Work</p>
